Currently, there are only two tables (models). The first one is `MetricSnapshot`, and the second one is `Metric`. I want to add another one. This new one will be called `Device`. It identifies the origin of a metric snapshot. Replace the `origin` attribute in `MetricSnapshot` with device and create a new model, `Device`, that holds an id (just like the existing models), along with a name (e.g. "Mac"). Please make sure this is linked properly with existing models and update code where necessary. Thank you.
